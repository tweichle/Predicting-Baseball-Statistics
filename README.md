**Goals**

- Using MLB Statcast Metrics, summarize and examine baseball statistics.

**Classification**
- Build and train models to predict home runs and extra-base hits implementing the following approaches:
    - Logistic Regression
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Decision-Classification Tree
    - Random Forest Classification
    - Support Vector Machine Classification
    - XGBoost Classification
    
- Implement over-sampling for imbalanced data to improve the quality of predictive modeling (i.e., generalizability).
- Apply regularization and cross-validation techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.

**Regression**
- Build and train models to predict hit distance implementing the following approaches:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision-Regression Tree
    - Random Forest Regression

- Apply regularization (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) and cross-validation (k-fold) techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.
