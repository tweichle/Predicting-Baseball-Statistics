**Goals**

- Using MLB Statcast Metrics, summarize and examine baseball statistics.

**Classification**
- Build and train models to predict home runs and extra-base hits implementing the following approaches:
    - Logistic Regression
    - k-Nearest Neighbors Classification
    - Decision Trees Classification
    - Random Forests Classification
    - Support Vector Machines Classification
    - XGBoost Classification
    - Neural Networks Classification
    
- Implement over-sampling for imbalanced data to improve the quality of predictive modeling (i.e., generalizability).
- Apply regularization and cross-validation techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.

**Regression**
- Build and train models to predict hit distance implementing the following approaches:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees Regression
    - Random Forests Regression

- Apply regularization (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) and cross-validation (k-fold) techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.
